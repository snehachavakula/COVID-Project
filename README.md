# COVID-Project

This repository showcases the SQL data preparation (using SSMS) behind my personal Tableau dashboarding project. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my SQL and Tableau abilities.

Project Title: Analysis of COVID-19 Deaths and Vaccination Data

Project Description:

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the entire world, and tracking the spread of the virus and its impact on different populations has become essential. The data will include information on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination rates by country, region, and other relevant factors. The objective of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization of COVID-19 deaths and vaccination data using SQL.

The data will be loaded into a relational database such as MySQL or SQL SERVER, and SQL queries will be used to perform EDA, and later data is visualized in TABLEAU.
Some of the questions that the project will address include:

What is the relationship between vaccination rates and COVID-19 mortality rates?
How have COVID-19 deaths and vaccination rates changed over time?
Are there any significant differences in COVID-19 deaths and vaccination rates between different countries or regions?
Are there any age or demographic groups that are more susceptible to COVID-19 deaths, and if so, how does vaccination affect their mortality rates?
The project will also provide recommendations and insights to policymakers and health officials on how to improve vaccination rates and reduce COVID-19 deaths.

Tools and technologies that will be used in the project include SQL & TABLEAU

Expected Deliverables:

Data analysis scripts
Data visualization charts and graphs
Report summarizing the findings and recommendations
